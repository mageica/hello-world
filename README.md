# hello-world
First github repository

Helloha,
My name is Katarina and I'm learning java. 
I'm not so creative with this..what should I write?
Sometime in the future I wanna make a video game and something cool with arduino/raspberry pi.
I am doing this now and when I'm done I will watch s07e02 of Game of Thrones!! so learning comes first...
